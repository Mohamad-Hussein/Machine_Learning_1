# Machine_Learning_1
This is my first set up of a knn machine learning model and the chosen dataset is made up. In this program, a knn machine learning model will get trained in order to predict a new instance given.
Split up training and testing dataset into 11:4. After the dataset has been fit to a model, it is then tested through the predict() function and create a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
## How to use
